TODO [ ] pressing o on includes should spawn a new empty one and move cursor

* SEARCH
TODO [ ] if the search found nothing until the end of the file wrap arround

TODO [ ] render line numbers only on buffers with more than long-file

* LSP
TODO [ ] goto_definition

* Dumb stuff to fix
TODO [ ] measure_whitespace_width only once on font switch rather than 4 times every frame
TODO [/]find_first_non_whitespace(and refactor, some functions could use it)
TODO [ ] use window height and width dynamically instead of fixed position when animations are off

* NEW FEATURES

TODO [ ] support multi line tokens
TODO [ ] check for strings in arrays
TODO [ ] multi line comments []
TODO IMPORTANT [ ] different vertex and fragment shader per token (need batch rendering)
TODO different font per token []

* DONE
Togglable indentation lines[x]
replace on typing when selection is true [x]
most symple vim style completion (ctrl + n in insert mode)[/] TODO it should cycle like vim
option to render whitespaces on selection [x]
switch true to false or false to true in editor_enter [x]
in M-x if the input is a number
go to that line in the editor if it exist [x]

keep a list of opened files to quickly
go to the previous or next "buffer" or kill them [x]
mismatched cut and selection [x]
