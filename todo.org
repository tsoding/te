** Drag Stuff
rename to drag_stuff_up/down/left/right
it should behave differently if editor.selection

* SEARCH

* LSP
TODO [ ] goto_definition

* Dumb stuff to fix
TODO [ ] measure_whitespace_width only once on font switch rather than 4 times every frame
TODO [/]find_first_non_whitespace(and refactor, some functions could use it)
